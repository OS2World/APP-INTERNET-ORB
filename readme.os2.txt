This is the OS/2 port of ORB, an HTML pre-processor, built with GCC 3.3.5.

All I did was modify the original makefile, creating a makefile.os2 to build it under GCC.

ORB is an interesting HTML preprocessor (but I'm afraid it's a little outdated): to read more
on it, consult the README files.

The OS2\ subdirectory contains the executable file and a copy of the documentation.

I hope it will be useful to those of us who still use a common text editor (or NEPMD, or EPM
with the HTML extensions...) to build their web pages (I still do).

As always, I hereby state there's NO WARRANTY at all for keeping or using this program. I also own
no credits for it, as I only rebuilt it for OS/2.
